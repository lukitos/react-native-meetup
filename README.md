## React Native Meetup - Building your first React Native app

Do you want to learn how to build native apps for both iOS and Android with a single code base and JavaScript/React skills? React Native will allow you to do that. This meetup will assume some knowledge of JavaScript and React.
I will walk you through building a simple list/detail app from scratch and then it's your turn! Crack open your laptops and let's code!
